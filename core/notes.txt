Strategy
 - emits signal
 -signal might want to buy at a certain time but there might be
            a queue of orders to be exectued, keep signal timestamp
            order and Trade timestamp separate

Market
 - contains data
 - market executes orders, generates trades

Portfolio
-portfolio takes in signals, generates orders, based on
available capital and rebalancing logic
- updates holdings and PnL, should be able to generate orders
from signals and update current positions after executed trades
- portfolio should also prevent wrong order generations, should catch it at
 order generation stage

TODO: in Portfolio do proper accounting of unrealised pnl from holdings
realised pnl and also total current portfolio value properly




Trade
 - trade timestamp can differ from signal/ order timestamp
 - the price of the trade is execution price, which then feeds back to
 portfolio to update holdings and Positions and pnl, etc..


ExecutionModel
 - once integrated with brokers feeds or execution models
     will either return true or false
     how much was actually executed and at what price
     for simplicity we now assume all orders are filled exactly at
     market price successfully with no slippage
     or with slippage for simplicity
